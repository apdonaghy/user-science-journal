          <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Stumptown Coffee Roasters is a gourmet coffee co. that sells a wide variety of beans and also has a small
            chain of coffee shops around the US. Their website can be found @ <a
              href=" https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/">stumptowncoffee.com</a> The main purpose of their site is to sell
            coffee beans and sign customers
            up to a subscription based delivery system. There are other features of the site, which are meant to inform
            users – where their shops are located and educating coffee drinkers on how to best prepare their coffee
            depending on the users preferred device. For this usability test I plan on focusing on the landing page
            although I may refer to pages that are accessible by digging into the site by one or two clicks.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conventions</h2>

          <p>
            Stumptown Coffee prides itself on being unique and maybe a little different (code for hipster – it is in
            Portland), which means that their site is more than likely to function in an unexpected way. I found this to
            be true while working through the site, but I especially noticed this in the top navigation. When the site
            loads the nav is placed underneath the hero image, which I found awkward and pointless. Once the user
            scrolls down the top nav becomes “sticky” and is anchored to the top of the screen like expected, but what
            is the reason for this transition? I really liked Krug’s explanation of when it’s ok to break conventions.
            <blockquote class="blockquote">“If you’re not going to use an existing Web convention, you need to be sure
              that what you’re replacing it
              with either (a) is so clear and self-explanatory that there’s no learning curve—so it’s as good as the
              convention, or (b) adds so much value that it’s worth a small learning curve.”</blockquote> I don’t feel
            like this
            unexpected nav placement meets either of these criteria.
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/revised.png" alt="revised site">

          <span class="caption text-muted">Edited image of landing page with nav in top position and button for hero
            ad</span>


          <h2 class="section-heading">Make it obvious what’s clickable</h2>

          <p>
            Krug talks about how buttons, should well… look like buttons. There should be a consistency in color,
            formatting and hover state that stands out from the rest of the content and lets the user know, THIS IS A
            BUTTON. One aspect of the Stumptown landing page that really bothers me is that the hero image is the
            button. It’s pretty common to see a landing page with a full width hero image that has centered text and a
            button underneath that links to a current promotion or the most recent news story, which is why it takes
            more than a millisecond to process that there is no button and the entire image is the link. They also get
            points deducted because their text is rasterized into the hero image, which is bad for usability as it can’t
            be used by screen-reader if it’s not live text.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Hierarchy</h2>


          <p>
            Essentially there is no hierarchy on the landing page of this site, it’s simply the hero image and then a
            list of products underneath in a two column grid until the user reaches the footer. Sure, I’m not crazy
            about landing pages with an overwhelming amount of copy, but there is no copy whatsoever, just images. What
            they failed to realize is that text looks cool, especially when formatted uniquely and used as “typographic
            candy.” Most sites I enjoy visiting have more variety on the landing page and enough content to organize in
            a hierarchical fashion – kind of like a snapshot of “what’s inside” so you can scan the page to find out
            where you want to go next.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Does this site get to the point without “happy talk”?</h2>

          <p>
            Moving on from the landing page – in general the copy written for this site avoids any unnecessary fluff.
            The <a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/subscriptions">subscription page</a> is an excellent example of
            this and is
            overall the most impressive page on the site. The page has concise writing and clean hierarchy, which is
            probably for a good reason – they want to sell subscriptions, so the developers devoted a lot of attention
            to this section.
          </p>
