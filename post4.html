                <h2 class="section-heading">Thoughts after the testing</h2>
                <p>
                  Once again, I was able to indicate two major issues in the usability of doordash.com. During my
                  usability tests
                  of the mobile site<strong> I found that all three users stumbled while attempting the tasks that were
                    confusing to me in
                    my initial review of the desktop version of the website</strong> – illustrating the point that some
                  features needed to be
                  redesigned to enhance usability on both the mobile and desktop platforms.
                </p>


                <h3>1. How does the user find the appropriate menu they want to order from, e.g., breakfast, lunch,
                  dinner?
                </h3>

                <p>
                  In the tasks I prompted the users with, I asked them to order from a menu that was not available at
                  the time they were ordering it – in this case it was McDonald’s breakfast to be delivered at a future
                  date and time (May 9th, 9:00 a.m.). Two of three users in this study scrolled up and down the listing of
                  options on the McDonald’s page for approx. 2-3 mins looking for breakfast items and searching in the
                  secondary navigation only to find that the options were being populated by lunch items. It wasn’t
                  until the 3 - 4 minute mark that these users noticed the "grayed out" button placed above the page’s
                  secondary navigation that reads “menus” with a dropdown arrow and allows the user to select which menu
                  they would like to order from (including breakfast).
                </p>
                <p>My assumption was that the users would be able to locate the menus button on the mobile version with
                  less frustration than the desktop. <strong>I thought that the smaller screen
                    and having fewer visual distractions would allow them to locate the “menus” button with more ease,
                    but
                    that turned out to be false.</strong> For two of the three users that I tested it took them several minutes to
                  find the "menus" button. This is of course an
                  improvement on the desktop test where three of three users were unable to find this button in a
                  reasonable amount of time. Two of three is still a cause for concern, so I would suggest making the
                  same adjustments on the web version of the site as I suggested for the desktop version.</p>

                <h4>How would I fix this?</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>I would add the “menus” dropdown button to the secondary nav as the first button.<strong> It’s the
                      first place two of the three users I tested looked and I think it would make sense to consolidate
                      this menu
                      here.</strong>
                  </li>
                  <li class="mt-2">As an alternative I would keep the menus button where it is, but make the background
                    color the brand red instead of light gray, which would help visibility.</li>
                </ul>
                <img class="img-fluid mt-5" src="img/mobile_rev1.jpg" alt="original menu">
                <figcaption class="caption text-muted">Current secondary nav without "menus" dropdown button (left).
                  Proposed secondary nav with "menus" dropdown placed in the first position (right)
                </figcaption>

                <h3 class="mt-5">2. How does the user set up an order for a future delivery date? </h3>

                <p>
                  Similar to the first prompt I thought this task would be simpler on a mobile device due to the smaller
                  screen size and consolidation of the U/I. However, once again my theory was incorrect and this task proved to be confusing to the users.
                  Though only two of three users stumbled while trying to achieve the task written in the instructions,
                  I would make a suggestion to alter the design in a similar fashion to the proposal I made for the
                  desktop version of the site, since two of three is technically the majority. </p>

                <p>The key issue is that the delivery time and date auto-populates with “ASAP.” On the mobile web app
                  this button has a sufficient
                  amount of whitespace and visibility, <strong>however there isn’t enough context for the meaning of
                    “ASAP” in that location and the styling does not visually imply that it’s a button.</strong></p>
            </p>

            <h4>How could this feature be improved?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Although I understand the thinking in making the default delivery date and time “ASAP” when
                considering the purpose of this app (to have food delivered quickly to fill an immediate desire) I
                think they should add a dropdown arrow to the button ASAP to make the user more aware that this is a
                button that has a dropdown feature which is not currently apparent. <strong>I also think it would be
                  more clear if they added the phrase “time of delivery” before “ASAP” to give it context.</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/mobile_rev2.jpg" alt="revised nav">
            <figcaption class="caption text-muted">Current nav where the user has no context for the acronym A.S.A.P. (left). Nav with added context for "A.S.A.P" and dropdown arrow to indicate functionality (right).
            </figcaption>

          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The results surprised me when I concluded these mobile tests. After going through the tasks on my own a few days before, I assumed a lot
              of things – mostly that there would be fewer issues with the user experience on a mobile device. Needless
              to say I was wrong. <strong>The tasks that proved difficult to users on the desktop version of the site were
              similarly complicated on the mobile version, which (to me) illustrated that although desktop and mobile
              devices can produce unique user experience issues, bad U/X design is confusing regardless of the device.</strong>
