              I conducted a usability test of the web app <a href="https://www.doordash.com/en-US">doordash.com</a>. The

                Roughly how many hours a week altogether—just a rough estimate— would you say you spend using the
                Internet, including Web browsing and email, at work and at home?
                What kinds of sites (work and personal) are you looking at when you browse the Web?

            <section>
              <h2 class="section-heading">Thoughts after the testing</h2>
              <p>
                I was able to indicate two major issues in the usability of doordash.com. During my usability tests
                <strong>I
                  found that all three users stumbled while attempting the tasks that were confusing to me in my initial
                  review of the website</strong> – illustrating the point that some features needed to be redesigned to
                enhance
                usability.
              </p>


              <h3>1. How does the user find the appropriate menu they want to order from, e.g., breakfast, lunch,
                dinner?
              </h3>

              <p>
                In the tasks I prompted the users with, I asked them to order from a menu that was not available at the
                time they were ordering it – in this case it was McDonald’s breakfast to be delivered at a future date
                and time. (May 2nd, 9:00 a.m.) Each of the three users scrolled up and down the listing of options on
                the McDonald’s page for approx. 2-3 mins looking for breakfast items and searching in the secondary
                navigation only to find that the options were being populated by lunch items. It wasn’t until the 3 - 4
                minute mark that each user noticed a button placed above the page’s secondary navigation that reads
                “menus” with a dropdown arrow and allows the user to select which menu they would like to order from
                (including breakfast). All of them missed it, which makes me think it’s not visible enough.
              </p>

              <h4>How would I fix this?</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>I would add the “menus” dropdown tab to the secondary nav as the first button.<strong> It’s the
                    first place
                    each of the three users I tested looked and I think it would make sense to consolidate this menu
                    here.</strong>
                </li>
                <li class="mt-2">As an alternative I would prompt the user before they got to this page with which menu
                  they would like to order from so that the page would populate with the items they’re expecting. In
                  this case there
                  would need to be a warning making the customer aware that they could only order breakfast between a
                  specific
                  window of time. </li>
              </ul>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/menu.jpg" alt="original menu">
              <figcaption class="caption text-muted">The menu dropdown should be moved to the secondary navigation for
                better visibility.</figcaption>
              <img class="img-fluid mt-5" src="img/menu2.jpg" alt="original menu">
              <figcaption class="caption text-muted">Mock-up of proposed secondary nav with menu dropdown.</figcaption>

              <h3 class="mt-5">2. How does the user set up an order for a future delivery date? </h3>

              <p>
                This task also proved to be confusing to all three users that I tested. The delivery time and date
                auto-populates with ASAP, which is placed in the upper left hand side of the browser window and does not
                appear to be a button. Each of the users had difficulty finding this button and expressed frustration
                and relief when they eventually figured it out.
              </p>

              <h4>How could this feature be improved?</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Although I understand the thinking in making the default delivery date and time “ASAP” when
                  considering the purpose of this app (to have food delivered quickly to fill an immediate desire) I
                  think they should add a dropdown arrow to the button ASAP to make the user more aware that this is a
                  button that has a dropdown feature which is not currently apparent. <strong>I also think it would be
                    more
                    clear if they added the phrase “time of delivery” before “ASAP” to give it context.</strong>
                </li>
                <li class="mt-2">They could also prompt the user to pick between ASAP delivery and future delivery on
                  the landing page so there would be less confusion moving forward for people who are looking to
                  schedule an order for a later date. </li>
              </ul>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/nav_original.png" alt="original nav">
              <figcaption class="caption text-muted">The current nav where you have no context to the acronym A.S.A.P.
              </figcaption>
              <img class="img-fluid mt-5" src="img/new_nav.png" alt="mock-up of navigation">
              <figcaption class="caption text-muted">Nav with added context for "A.S.A.P" and dropdown to indicate
                functionality.</figcaption>


            </section>

            <section>
              <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>Ultimately I think this site has good usability. It’s clean and organized and I feel like I’m able to
                complete the tasks I want to without too much confusion. That being said I believe <a
                  href="https://www.doordash.com/en-US">doordash.com</a> should
                add updates to make it easier to order food in advance or for a later date. The assumption that their
                customers want food “ASAP” is probably the right one, but that doesn’t mean that they should neglect the
                usability of their site for customers who are using less popular features. They obviously added the “set
                delivery date” feature to the site to fill a specific need, why would they make it difficult to use?</p>
